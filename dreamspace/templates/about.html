For Pyschology 133 outreach project.

Dreams have been accounted for multiple nobel prizes and countless screenplays and works of art. The problem of dreams is that we tend to forget them within the first hour of waking. This project allows users to track their dreams and what not. They will also get a fact of the day telling them about dreams and who how.
